  "fruit_2_good": "Contains magnesium, vitamins, potassium, and other things that are the top for the immune system. Grated lemon, so -called \"zest\", gives the pasta sauce that little extra.",
  "fruit_3_good": "Rich in unsaturated fats. Contains vitamin D and potassium, which helps control the heart rhythm. Exquisite on rye sandwich with chili flakes.",
  "fruit_4_good": "Good, satisfying and full of important nutrients. The banana is also rich in magnesium and potassium, which makes it a recurring favorite in the exercise bag.",
